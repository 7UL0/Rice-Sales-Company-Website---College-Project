# Website for a Rice Sales Company - School Project

This project was a final assignment for the Website Design course, in which students were required to utilize their HTML and CSS coding skills acquired throughout the semester. The goal was to design and develop a website for a fictional rice sales company, which was entirely conceptualized by me. The website showcases various rice products, company information, and contact details, all presented in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.
